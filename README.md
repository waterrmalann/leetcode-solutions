# Leetcode Writeups

This repository is to maintain a list of submissions as well as writeups to some interesting Leetcode questions I've personally come across. I try to prioritize more of data structures and algorithms style questions rather than trivial ones but you may find any sort of questions here.

Python is used because I think that it reads like pseudocode for the most part, and so it should be fairly easy to understand even if you don't know the language. I've also wrote JavaScript solutions for every problem, and occasionally TypeScript as well.
